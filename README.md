## Approaches

**Brute force approache :**

**step1 :**

initialize the one new list to stored the numbers(ends with 7)
and named as ans.

**step 2:**
input list each element converted to string

**step 3:** And chech the indivudual string last character is '7' or not if last character is '7' then convert string to number and added to ans list.

**step 5:** print the ans list.

**TC:** O(n2)

**SC:** o(1)

## Final Approach

**step 1:**

Let take the one iterater loop like for or while and initialize the one ans list is used to stored the numbers(ends with 7).

**step 2:**

And iterate the total list and checks the if element in the list module 10 is equal to 7 or not.if it is 7 then add to the element to ans list


**Complexity**

**Time complexity**: O(n )

**Space complexity**: O( 1 )

## Approaches

## Final Approach

**step 1:**

Let take the one iterater loop like for or while and initialize the one variable i.

**step 2:**

And let take the another iterater like a nested iterater and initialize the another varible like j.

**step 2:**

j variable iterate up to i variable lenth once j is over that loop terminated and i will became increases and once i varible reach the size then two loops are termintaed.
